                <h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ben.</h3>
                <p>
                    I've been a Seattle-based software development engineer since graduating from UC San Diego with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science in 2023. 
                    I was admitted as a National Merit Scholar and was awarded the Shores Scholarship, the highest-valued merit-based scholarship available at UCSD. 
                    During my University career, I was a student government officer for three years and became President of the Kendo Club at UC San Diego.

                    I also practice kendo and play the guitar. I have achieved the rank of kendo 1-kyu and have had the privilege of practicing with:
