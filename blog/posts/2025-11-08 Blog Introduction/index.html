                <h2>Notes on the new blog section</h2>
<p>Hey! If you're reading this, you've found the new <code>Blog</code> page on my site. This is where I'll sporadically post long(ish)-form discussions when I want to put something out on a public page. I created this both for the purpose of having a blog as well as to experiment with building a content generation workflow from scratch. The first two posts are dated to the dates when I wrote them in their original form. Similarly to the blog page as a whole, these are here to serve as blog posts as well as testing posts for my Markdown-to-HTML conversion script. See the repo at <code>Projects -&gt; Personal Site</code> for more details on that.</p>
<p>You may also have noticed that this site has moved from a single-page application architecture to a multi-page application. This was a lengthy refactoring effort that I had to undertake to accommodate the new blog page, as the janky JavaScript-dependent transitions I originally built just wouldn't support it. I also may or may not have discovered that my JavaScript-powered theme management was completely unnecessary and could be handled much more cleanly with CSS rules. Shout out to <a href="https://www.austinatchley.xyz/">Austin</a>, my mentor from my first internship, whose website I ruthlessly inspect-elemented for inspiration while cleaning up this site. </p>
<p>I was wisely advised that it's not too late to switch to a higher-level framework like React.js or Hugo, but saving myself all that work would've made far too much sense. So, yeah, this page is still native HTML+CSS+JS. The CSS animation for switching between pages is gone, but I was getting sick of looking at it and it was a pain in the ass to maintain as I added to the site. I'm a lover of all things dumb and impractical, but I just don't have the time to keep that around. </p>
<p>More posts about ham radio and possibly an RSS feed coming soon.</p>
