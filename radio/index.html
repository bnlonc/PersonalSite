            <h4>Hi! I'm a newly-licensed ham interested in CW, digital mobile radio decoding, and satellite listening.</h4>

            <h4>As I gain skills, experience, and equipment, I'll add resources and info that were helpful to me to this page.</h4>

                <h2>General Reference</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@COASTALWAVESWIRES">COASTAL WAVES & WIRES (K4OGO) on YouTube</a>: A good channel for info on all kinds of antennas, especially for HF. Doesn't cover much in the realm of antennas for small spaces, but good for getting an idea of what's possible.</p>
                <p><a href="https://k7mem.com/Misc_Band_Plan.html">K7MEM's interactive amateur band plan</a>: My usual reference for getting oriented on the bands, since it includes all the info I need in a more visual format.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="cw">
                <h2>CW</h2>
                <h4>Learning</h4>
                <p><a href="https://lcwo.net/">LCWO.net</a>: An excellent site for CW drills. I found the Koch method course challenging, but I'm improving my copying skills a lot by just sticking with it and repeating each lesson until the new characters stick.</p>
                <h4>Gear</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Utahforrest">UtahForrest (KI7QCF) on YouTube</a>: A good channel for advice on choosing equipment and getting set up as a beginner.</p>
